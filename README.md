# EV-Range-QSS
This repository contains a QSS (Quasi Static Simulation ) Simulink model for estimating the range of an electric vehicle (EV). The model incorporates various components and models, such as the battery model, motor model, drivetrain model, and road load model, to simulate the energy consumption and estimate the range of the EV.
